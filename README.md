####Simple Shell Project

This project implements a simple command-line shell similar to existing shells like Bash or Zsh.
About

This project aims to provide a basic understanding of shell programming by implementing functionalities like:

- Accepting user input for commands.
- Executing built-in commands or external programs.
- Handling arguments passed to commands.
- Providing basic error handling.

This project can serve as a learning tool for beginners interested in system programming and understanding the core functionalities of a shell.
Features (This section can be expanded as you implement more features)

- Accepts user input for commands.
- Executes basic built-in commands like:
- exit: Terminates the shell.
- cd: Changes the working directory.
- echo: Prints arguments to the console.
- Supports basic execution of external programs with arguments.

##Running the Project

#Prerequisites
A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

#Compilation:

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Compile the source code using your preferred compiler:
```bash
gcc -Wall *.c -o my_shell # Replace "my_shell" with your desired executable name
```


##Execution:

Run the compiled executable:
```bash
./my_shell

$       
```
The shell prompt will appear ($).
 
Enter commands and press Enter to execute them.

Type exit to exit the shell.

##Future Enhancements (This section can be filled with planned features)

- Implement additional built-in commands (e.g., ls, pwd).
- Support command history and navigation.
- Implement environment variables and expansion.
- Handle I/O redirection (e.g., <, >, |).
- Improve error handling and provide informative messages.
